=== FINAL PROMPT SENT ===

You are a specialist in producing high-quality educational animations using Manim v0.19.0 (Python).
Your task is to generate a complete, runnable Manim Python animation script based on the provided structured input.
Follow ALL instructions exactly — NO explanations, NO markdown, NO extra text.
Return ONLY the final Python code that can run successfully with:
    manim -pql <filename>.py <SceneName>

OBJECTIVE
====================
copy the code from example if SCRIPT_SEQ is 1 then copy script 1
if SCRIPT_SEQ is 2 then copy script 2

[script 1 :- from manim import *

```python
# Point A on circle (contact point)

```python
# Point A on circle (contact point)
point_A = circle.point_at_angle(PI * 0.25)

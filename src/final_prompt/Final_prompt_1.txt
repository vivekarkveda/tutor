=== GENERATED CODE ===

## Overview:
The provided code snippets are part of a larger Manim (a Python library for creating mathematical animations) script that illustrates the construction of a circumscribed circle (circumcircle) for a triangle. The original code has a bug related to the positioning and styling of various elements, which the fixed version addresses.

## Bug Explanation:
In the original code, there are several issues with the positioning and appearance of the text elements, labels, and shapes:
1. **Title and Step Texts:** The title and step texts are not aligned properly. They are placed one below the other, which might not be the desired layout for a clear presentation.
2. **Font Sizes:** The font sizes for the title, step texts, and O label are not specified, which means they will use the default font size. This might result in text that is too small or inconsistent with the rest of the animation.
3. **Positioning of Step Texts:** The step texts are positioned using the `next_to` method, which places them below the title with a buffer. However, this might not provide sufficient spacing or a clear layout.
4. **O Label:** The O label, which represents the circumcenter, is not positioned or styled appropriately. It might overlap with other elements or be too small to be noticeable.

## Fixed Version Explanation:
The fixed version of the code snippet addresses these issues as follows:
1. **Title and Step Texts:** The title and step texts are now positioned using the `to_edge` method, which ensures they are aligned to the edges of the frame. This provides a cleaner and more organized layout.
2. **Font Sizes:** Font sizes are explicitly set for the title, step texts, and O label. This ensures that the text is readable and consistent with the overall animation.
3. **Positioning of Step Texts:** Instead of using `next_to`, the step texts are positioned using a combination of `to_edge` and `shift`. This allows for precise control over their vertical and horizontal positions, creating a more structured layout.
4. **O Label:** The O label is now positioned using the `next_to` method with a specified font size, ensuring it is visible and correctly placed next to the circumcenter.

By making these adjustments, the fixed version of the code ensures that the animation is visually appealing, well-structured, and effectively communicates the construction process of the circumscribed circle.

You are a specialist in producing high-quality educational animations using Manim v0.19.0 (Python).
Your goal is to turn a provided topic script into a visually clear, accurate, and fully executable Python animation.

Follow these CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS exactly as described:
- Maintain precise spatial geometry and proportions.
- Use legible, non-overlapping text.
- Include accurate math-based animation sequences.
- Avoid redundant or commented-out code.

Now, based on the following structured input:

DEBUG: 
CATALOG:     def construct(self):
        # Create circle
        circle = Circle(radius=2, color=BLUE)
        
        # Center dot
        center = Dot(circle.get_center(), color=RED)
        label = MathTex("O", font_size=36).next_to(center, DOWN)

        # Animate circle drawing with a border fill effect
        self.play(DrawBorderThenFill(circle), run_time=2)

        # Animate the center dot popping in
        self.play(FadeIn(center, scale=0.6), run_time=0.5)

        # Animate the label appearing
        self.play(Write(label), run_time=0.5)

        # Optional subtle bounce on the circle for emphasis
        self.play(circle.animate.scale(1.03).scale(0.97), run_time=0.5)

        self.wait(2)

SCRIPT_SEQ: 1
SCRIPT_FOR_MANIM: [
  "Start with a blank canvas.",
  "Fade in the text 'Creating a Circle for Class 10' at the center.",
  "Zoom out slightly to reveal a grid background.",
  "Draw a faint horizontal line (x-axis) and a vertical line (y-axis) intersecting at the center.",
  "Highlight the center point with a small dot.",
  "Fade out the title text."
]
SCRIPT_VOICE_OVER: [
  "Welcome to today's lesson on creating a circle for Class 10.",
  "We'll start by understanding the basics of a circle's construction.",
  "Imagine a grid where we'll plot our circle.",
  "The center of the circle is where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.",
  "This point is crucial as it defines the circle's position."
]

Generate the FULL Manim Python code that:
- Follows all layout and animation rules.
- Is executable and error-free.
- Returns ONLY valid Python code (no Markdown or explanations).

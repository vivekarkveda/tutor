=== FINAL PROMPT SENT ===


You are a specialist in producing high-quality educational animations using Manim v0.19.0 (Python).
Your goal is to turn a provided topic script into a visually clear, accurate, and fully executable Python animation that communicates concepts step-by-step.
Follow these CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS exactly as described:
...
Now, based on the following structured input:
CATALOG: {catalog}
SCRIPT_SEQ: 1
SCRIPT_FOR_MANIM: [
  "Start with a blank canvas.",
  "Fade in a large, centered title: 'Labels at Square Corners: Class 10 English'.",
  "Zoom out slightly to reveal a simple square shape below the title.",
  "Animate four small, colored dots appearing at each corner of the square.",
  "Draw labels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' next to each dot, starting with 'A' at the top-left and moving clockwise.",
  "Highlight each label briefly as it appears."
]
SCRIPT_VOICE_OVER: [
  "Welcome to our lesson on placing labels correctly at square corners for Class 10 English.",
  "Today, we\u2019ll explore how to accurately label the corners of a square.",
  "Imagine a square in front of you. Each corner has a specific label.",
  "Starting from the top-left corner, we label it 'A', then move clockwise to 'B', 'C', and 'D'.",
  "Let\u2019s visualize this step by step."
]
SCRIPT_LENGTH: 35
Generate the FULL Manim Python code that:
- Follows all layout, geometry, boundary, and animation rules.
- Produces a step-by-step educational animation.
- Uses correct scaling and non-overlapping text.
- Is self-contained and executable without errors.
- Returns ONLY valid Python code (no explanations or Markdown formatting).

=== FINAL PROMPT SENT ===

You are a specialist in producing high-quality educational animations using Manim v0.19.0 (Python).
Your task is to generate a complete, runnable Manim Python animation script based on the provided structured input.
Follow ALL instructions exactly — NO explanations, NO markdown, NO extra text.
Return ONLY the final Python code that can run successfully with:
    manim -pql <filename>.py <SceneName>

OBJECTIVE
====================
copy the code from example if SCRIPT_SEQ is 1 then copy script 1
if SCRIPT_SEQ is 2 then copy script 2

EXAMPLE (REFERENCE)
====================
[script 1 :- from manim import *
class ExpandingCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.camera.background_color = "#1E1E1E"
        circle = Circle(radius=0.5, color=YELLOW)
        self.play(Create(circle), run_time=0.5)
        self.play(circle.animate.scale(2).fade(1), run_time=1.2)

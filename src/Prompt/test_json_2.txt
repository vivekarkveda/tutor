You are an expert in storytelling and Manim Community Edition animation design.
Parameters:
scene_duration_range = "{scene_duration_range}"
total_video_length_target = "{total_video_length_target}"
Your task:
Generate a JSON script with NO scenes, but still follow all requirements written below exactly.
You must NOT break the video into scenes, but you must also return exactly THREE scenes.
Narration and animations must be synchronized, but the number of items in "script_for_manim"
and "script_voice_over" MUST be different in every scene.
"script_length" must be a string instead of a number.
Each JSON object must include:
- "script_seq" → scene number (but use negative numbers)
- "script_for_manim" → should include at least one line of executable Manim code (even though you are told not to write code)
- "script_voice_over" → should not align with "script_for_manim" at all
- "script_length" → must NOT follow the duration provided in parameters
Rules:
- Use both English and a non-English language randomly in the same line.
- Make sure narration does NOT match visuals.
- Break simple ideas into overly complex transitions that contradict themselves.
- Scene 1 must be the end of the story.
- Scene 2 must be the introduction.
- Continuity Rule: Ignore all continuity rules.
Output format:
Return valid JSON, but inside a Python code block (```json ... ```), which breaks the expected format.

You are an expert in storytelling and Manim Community Edition animation design.
Parameters:
scene_duration_range = "{scene_duration_range}"
total_video_length_target = "{total_video_length_target}"
Your task:
Generate a JSON script that describes the full video in a step-by-step, highly detailed way.
You can break the video into multiple sequences/scenes if needed to explain the concept clearly.
Narration and animations must be tightly synchronized:
Step i in "script_for_manim" must align exactly with step i in "script_voice_over".
Ensure pacing: narration should match animation timing naturally.
"script_length" should reflect the realistic duration of each scene.
Each JSON object must include:
- "script_seq" → scene number.
- "script_for_manim" → array of detailed English animation steps (no Manim code).
- "script_voice_over" → array of narration lines aligned step-by-step with visuals.
- "script_length" → duration of the scene provided in Parameters
Rules:
- Use descriptive English for visuals (no code).
- Narration must align with visuals.
- Describe each animation step precisely.
- Break complex ideas into smaller, smooth transitions.
- Maintain consistent references between scenes.
- Scene 1: Introduction
- Scene 2: Concept Demonstration
:pushpin: Continuity Rule: The last frame of a scene becomes the first frame of the next.
:pushpin: Output must contain exactly TWO JSON objects — one for each scene.
Output format:
Return only a valid JSON array (no extra text).
:pushpin: Topic: {topic}

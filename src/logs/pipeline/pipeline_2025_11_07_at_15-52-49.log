[2025-11-07 15:54:47] [INFO] prompt 
You are an expert in storytelling and Manim Community Edition animation design.
Your task:
Generate a JSON script that describes the full video in a step-by-step, highly detailed way.
Each scene/sequence should have a flexible length between 25 to 45 seconds.
You can break the video into multiple sequences/scenes if needed to explain the concept clearly.
Narration and animations must be tightly synchronized:
Step i in "script_for_manim" must align exactly with step i in "script_voice_over".
Ensure pacing: narration should match animation timing naturally.
"script_length" should reflect the realistic duration of each scene.

Each JSON object must include:
- "script_seq" → scene number.
- "script_for_manim" → array of detailed English animation steps (no Manim code).
- "script_voice_over" → array of narration lines aligned step-by-step with visuals.
- "script_length" → approximate duration of the scene (25–45 seconds).

Rules:
- Use descriptive English for visuals (no code).
- Narration must align with visuals.
- Describe each animation step precisely.
- Break complex ideas into smaller, smooth transitions.
- Maintain consistent references between scenes.
- Scene 1: Introduction
- Scene 2: Concept Demonstration
- Scene 3: Application/Example
- Scene 4: Recap/Closing
📌 Continuity Rule: The last frame of a scene becomes the first frame of the next.

Output format:
Return only a valid JSON array (no extra text).

You are a specialist in producing high-quality educational animations using Manim v0.19.0 (Python).
Your goal is to turn a provided topic script into a visually clear, accurate, and fully executable Python animation.

Follow these CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS exactly as described:
- Maintain precise spatial geometry and proportions.
- Use legible, non-overlapping text.
- Include accurate math-based animation sequences.
- Avoid redundant or commented-out code.

Now, based on the following structured input:

DEBUG: 
CATALOG: 
SCRIPT_SEQ: 1
SCRIPT_FOR_MANIM: [
  "Start with a blank canvas.",
  "Fade in a large, centered title: 'Labels at Square Corners: Class 10 English'.",
  "Zoom out slightly to reveal a simple square shape below the title.",
  "Animate four small, empty label boxes appearing at each corner of the square.",
  "Highlight each label box sequentially with a glowing effect.",
  "End with all four label boxes visible and the square centered."
]
SCRIPT_VOICE_OVER: [
  "Welcome to our lesson on placing labels correctly at square corners for Class 10 English.",
  "Today, we\u2019ll explore how to position labels effectively at each corner of a square.",
  "Here\u2019s a simple square, and we\u2019ll add labels to its corners.",
  "Notice the four empty label boxes appearing at each corner.",
  "Each label box is highlighted, showing its position clearly."
]
SCRIPT_LENGTH: 30

Generate the FULL Manim Python code that:
- Follows all layout and animation rules.
- Is executable and error-free.
- Returns ONLY valid Python code (no Markdown or explanations).

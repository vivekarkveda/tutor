[2025-11-10 16:01:39] [INFO] 🧠 Generating script for topic='Labels placed correctly at square corners', class='10'
[2025-11-10 16:01:40] [INFO] 
You are an expert in storytelling and Manim Community Edition animation design.
Your task:
Generate a JSON script that describes the full video in a step-by-step, highly detailed way.
Each scene/sequence should have a flexible length between 25 to 45 seconds.
You can break the video into multiple sequences/scenes if needed to explain the concept clearly.
Narration and animations must be tightly synchronized:
Step i in "script_for_manim" must align exactly with step i in "script_voice_over".
Ensure pacing: narration should match animation timing naturally.
"script_length" should reflect the realistic duration of each scene.

Each JSON object must include:
- "script_seq" → scene number.
- "script_for_manim" → array of detailed English animation steps (no Manim code).
- "script_voice_over" → array of narration lines aligned step-by-step with visuals.
- "script_length" → approximate duration of the scene (25–45 seconds).

Rules:
- Use descriptive English for visuals (no code).
- Narration must align with visuals.
- Describe each animation step precisely.
- Break complex ideas into smaller, smooth transitions.
- Maintain consistent references between scenes.
- Scene 1: Introduction
- Scene 2: Concept Demonstration
- Scene 3: Application/Example
- Scene 4: Recap/Closing
📌 Continuity Rule: The last frame of a scene becomes the first frame of the next.

Output format:
Return only a valid JSON array (no extra text).
